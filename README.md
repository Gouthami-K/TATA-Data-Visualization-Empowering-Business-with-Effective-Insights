# TATA-Data-Visualization-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights
The internship included 4 tasks:
       ## 1. Framing the Business Scenario
      For this task, we need to draft questions, eight questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO) that are both quantitative and qualitative.It should be             important and relevant to the CEO and CMO.
      A dataset has been provided as the basis for exploration. Data has to be reviewed, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights one can               garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.
        
       ## 2. Choosing the Right Visuals
      This task will help us get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for       the given data. To complete this task, we need to answer the 5 multiple choice questions. Each question will contain a unique scenario and are expected to answer         the questions based on that scenario.
       
       ##3. Creating Effective Visuals
       Here before begining the analysis, we have make sure that the data is cleaned properly. 
       Data cleaning:we need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from                analysis.We can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data.
       ● Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
       ● Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0
       
       In this task, we create the visuals for the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. We can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals.
       


Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.
       
       ##4. Communicating Insights and Analysis
      In this task we need to develop a script and record a video presenting our findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals           created in the previous tasks.
      The script, the should contain the entire process, including the initial data load and clean-up steps so that leaders know that we have done our due diligence in       providing error-free analysis. 
      Data analysis provides heaps of information but we need to focus on the information that is most important to the leaders.
